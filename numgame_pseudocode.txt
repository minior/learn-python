I still do not see the full value of pseudocoding yet, since I caught mistakes only after coding

#ask for name, validate
print hello whats your name
user_name = input()
if username is empty, throw error
elif check if all alphabets, continue
else print error, loop back



# generate a random no. betw 1 & 10, user has 6 guesses

# generate no.
ans = random int between 1 and 10

#allow user input
print "Welcome, username, im thinking of a number between 1 and 10"

#compare, then if elif flow control, ever try require input again
attempt = 0
for attempts below 5
    guess = input()
    try: (use int)
        if guess is correct:
            print that's correct!
        elif guess is below 1, above 10:
            print that's not between 1 and 10
            guess = input()
        elif guess higher than ans:
            print too high!
            guess = input()
        elif guess lower than ans:
            print too low!
            guess = input()
    except to catch non-integers value error
        print that's not a number!
        attempt + 1
        guess = input()
